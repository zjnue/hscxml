<!-- Test that the state machine halts when it enters a top-level final state.  Since
 the initial state is a final state, this machine should halt immediately without
 processing "event1" which is raised in the final state's on-entry handler.  This
 is a manual test since there is no platform-independent way to test that event1
 is not processed -->
